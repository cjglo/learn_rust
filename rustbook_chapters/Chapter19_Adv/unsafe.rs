	// four "powers" given by unsafe:


	// 1. Raw Pointers
		// Can use raw pointers, which don't follow borrow rules or non-null rule
		// Must clean up

	// 2. Calling an unsafe function
		// unsafe functions are esentially like unsafe blocks, by calling them we
		// are saying we have read the docs and know how to use it properly

	// 3.
